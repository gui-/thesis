\section{Objectives (1pg)}
\label{sec:obj}

This work addresses two challenges:
\begin{itemize}
\item lack of documentation in the programs
\item program comprehension improvement.
\end{itemize}

To overcome it, we will investigate better ways to help programmers in their conceptual tasks. 

\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textit{Objectives:} This work aims at designing and implementing tools for programming development that support and encourage new ways of thinking, and enable programmers to see and understand the execution of their programs. These tools will be designed to work cohesively. 
\end{itemize}

Our approach to address this problem is, at first, to analyze, which components are particularly important, and which are the essential tools in a programming environment. Further, to emphasize which of them are used for static analysis (reading the code), e.g. traceability mechanisms and dynamic analysis (running the code), e.g. immediate feedback. 

The project will produce the following expected results:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textit{Expected result:}  The work will produce \textit{i)} a specification of each tool, its purpose and how this tool will improve the productivity; \textit{ii)} a coherent implementation of a prototype and \textit{iii)} an experimental evaluation using a real programming system.
\end{itemize}

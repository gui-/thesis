\section{Objectives}

This work addresses two challenges:

\begin{itemize}
\item support the program comprehension process.
\item minimize the lack of documentation in the programs.
\end{itemize}

To overcome it, we will investigate better ways to help programmers in their conceptual tasks. The objective is to design and implement innovative tools which support and encourage new ways of thinking enabling programmers to see and understand their programs.

Our approach to achieve this objective is, firstly, analyze which tools are particularly important to improve the program comprehension. Fortunately, the Learnable Programming~\cite{learnableProg,inventingPrin} shows interesting insights in this direction. Secondly, based on this analysis, we will propose and implement two interactive tools: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item \textit{code correlation tool} which correlates image with code. The source code pass to be commented with visual images rather than just plain text. This enables programmers to effortless read the code acquiring a better mental model.
\item \textit{live code execution tool} which executes the program upon changes. This tool minimizes the latency until the code written be executed. Encouraging users to experiment ideas quickly augmenting their comprehension about the program.
\end{enumerate}

This project will produce the following expected results:
 
\begin{itemize}
\item[] \textit{Expected results:} \textit{i)} a specification of each tool, its purpose and how this tool will be designed to support its purpose; \textit{ii)} a coherent implementation of a prototype; and \textit{iii)} an experimental evaluation with a comparison to other similar tools.
\end{itemize}

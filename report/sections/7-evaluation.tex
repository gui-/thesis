\section{Evaluation (1/2pgs)}
\label{sec:eval}

Our proposed architecture will be implemented on top of DrRacket~\ac{ide}. This decision is due to the fact that DrRacket~\ac{ide} be designed to be pedagogical and it conserves the same principle we search for. Furthermore, to evaluate our proposal we intend to proceed as follows:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Evaluation metrics:} to assess the quality of our system, we plan to test individually each tool with specific test case scenarios and the correctness of each tool, i.e. if they work as expected. In a similar way, the security will be tested as well.

\item \textbf{Test with real GD programs:} the proposed tools will be tested  with progressively complex \ac{gd} programs, used as benchmark. We expected that a certain limit the the interactive tools stoop to work. However, using mechanism to deal with performance we expect to increase this limit.

\item \textbf{Comparison with other systems:} we can only claim that our solution is somehow better than other if we compare both. Therefore we plan to compare our system tool to tool with the existing programming environments for generative design. 
\end{itemize}

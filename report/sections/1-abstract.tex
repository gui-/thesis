\begin{abstract}

Programs are rarely released with useful documentation. Therefore, when the documentation is poor, obsolete, or absent, the remaining option is to study the program itself. Over the years, many environments have been proposed to write, document, and comprehend a program. This report presents a survey of those environments, and proposes some innovative tools to improve the current state of the art.

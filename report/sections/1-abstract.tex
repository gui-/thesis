\begin{abstract}

Programs are usually released without documentation. Therefore, when the documentation is poor, obsolete, or absent, the remaining option is to study the program itself. Over the years, many tools have been proposed to help in this process. This report presents a survey of systems which provides some of those tools and proposes some possible lines of research to improve the current state of the art.

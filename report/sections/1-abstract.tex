\begin{abstract}

The current programming environments force users to think as a machine, which leads programming be seen as a difficult and obscure art. Here, we presented a study over the existing systems which address this problem. In a critical perspective, we highlighted their main insights and limitations.Inspired by this study, we proposed a programming environment with two interactive tools: (1) image in the code and (2) immediate feedback. While the first correlates code with image, the second displays the program's output as the user types. We expect that using images in the code will enhance the power of program documentation while giving a meaning to the code. It arises challenges such as how to effectively combine code with image and what kind of image we should expect. On the other hand, immediate feedback gives to the user an express via to test their thoughts enabling to design exploration. However, this interactiveness implies acceptable performance since the program is constantly running.

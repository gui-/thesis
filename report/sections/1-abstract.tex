\begin{abstract}

Evolving over the years, software systems have become very complicated and have gained many different application areas. Therefore, it is crucial to have mechanisms which facilitate the development and understanding of software systems. This report presents an overview of interactive development systems and discusses a set of extensions that help the development and understanding of software systems. The environment proposed in this project leverages hybrid correlation mechanisms and provides immediate feedback allowing the user to immediately see the result of its action.

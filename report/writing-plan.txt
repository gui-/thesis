Abstract

Keywords

Introduction

-What is the reason behind the study?
	-lack of tools which enable novice programmers to read and understand their code.
	-lack of tools which support program documentation and program comprehension.
	-lack of a programming environment that enables beginner users to (1) effortless read the code and (2) immediately see the result of their actions.

-What does the study demonstrate?
	-the existing programming environments which provide those features are not suitable for beginners.
	-among the area of generative design there is no such programming environment.

-What is the necessary background info to understand the study?
	-The reader should be introduced to:
		-program documentation; text only
		-program comprehension; read the code, experiment ideas
		-generative design
		-programing environment
		-live code environment
		-immediate feedback

-What were the tested hypotheses?
	-proposed two interactive tools to integrate in a generative design program environment: (1) image in the code correlation and (2) live code.

-What is the hypothesis? (at end of introduction)
	-the programming environment can improve program comprehension and program documentation
	-as a result, programming become accessible for novices and  documentation become reliable

Objectives
-study how one can create tools to improve programming comprehension
-design and implement two tools for a programming environment
-experiment the tools using it in a real programming system.

Summary
-Summarize according to (i) type (ii) image support (iii) immediate feedback (iv) interactive widgets (v) traceability (vi) show comparisons


Architecture

-Highlight the importance of the work.

-Decisions made. The proposed tools will be developed on top of DrRacket IDE, because of
	-be a pedagogical IDE
	-supports of image
	-already has arrows mechanism
	-use of different programming languages

-Proposed architecture

Evaluation
-We will use Rosetta as case of study.

\begin{abstract}

In the area of \gls{gd}, programs are becoming increasingly complex and harder to understand, communicate, and share, enlarging the gap between them and the architectural concepts they implements. To overcome this problem, we need to develop documentation techniques and program comprehension tools to the Generative Design domain. This thesis proposes two programming tools for \gls{gd}  systems, namely (1) sketch-program correlation tool that allows architects to use sketches and combining them with code, and (2) immediate feedback tool that accelerates the effect of a code change and its visualization. We found that while the first tool turns program documentation in a less tiresome task, consequently minimizing the lack of documentation in the  \gls{gd} programs; the second tool enhances the program visualization, creating a new medium that helps people to design programs.
